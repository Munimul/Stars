          A constellation is an area on the celestial sphere in which a group of
          visible stars forms a perceived pattern or outline, typically
          representing an animal, mythological subject, or inanimate object. In
          1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally accepted the
          modern list of 88 constellations, and in 1928 adopted official
          constellation boundaries that together cover the entire celestial
          sphere. Any given point in a celestial coordinate system lies in one
          of the modern constellations.

        The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to prehistory.
        People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences,
        creation, or mythology. Different cultures and countries invented their
        own constellations, some of which lasted into the early 20th century
        before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The
        recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many
        changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into
        obscurity. Some were limited to a single culture or nation. Naming
        constellations also helped astronomers and navigators identify stars
        more easily.
