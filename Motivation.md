## Know Thy Stars

This web app's objective lies in creating a simple informative platfrom from which user can easily access information about our sky's STARS and
which Constellation they belong to. There are plenty of resources out there which have detailed information about stars, planets, solar systems, constellations and lot more. This application aims to guide people like me, to to enter in the vast realm of Astronomy(NOT ASTROLOGY!) from a little curious question like, "What is the name of that star?". I hope people find it useful.
